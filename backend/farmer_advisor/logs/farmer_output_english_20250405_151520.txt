Here's a feasible and cost-effective farm planning for growing Wheat on 3 acres of land with the following inputs:

1. Expected yield: According to the data provided, the average yield of Wheat in our region is 20.46 tons per hectare (ha). This can be increased by up to 5% as a result of good weather conditions or fertilization.

2. Fertilizer need: The farmer needs to purchase 418.4 kg of fertilizer per year for the crop, which costs around Rs. 60,000/ha. They can buy it from a local agro-chemical supplier or make use of available subsidies in the region.

3. Pest and weed control: The farmer needs to purchase fertilizer for pest and weed control every three months, costing around Rs. 2,500/ha. They can hire a pest control service or do it themselves by purchasing organic or natural pesticides available in the region.

4. Planting: The farmer can choose to plant Wheat from early spring (before monsoon) for better yields and harvesting. Alternatively, they can select early-maturing varieties that require less water and can be harvested earlier.

5. Irrigation: The farmer can install a rainwater harvesting system or use natural groundwater sources to irrigate the Wheat crop. Water costs around Rs. 10,000/ha for the year, which can be recouped through increased yield and better quality of Wheat.

6. Sustainability: To maintain soil fertility and reduce soil erosion, the farmer should plant cover crops like maize or legumes after each Wheat crop. They can also use organic fertilizers made from natural sources like cow dung or compost to avoid synthetic fertilizers.

7. Timing: The farmer can start planting Wheat in late spring (after monsoon), which increases the yield and reduces water needs. Alternatively, they can wait for a better growing season before planting to maximize crop yields and minimize losses due to drought.

8. Monitoring and feedback: The farmer should regularly monitor the crop's growth and output to optimize production and reduce costs. They can use a variety of data sources, such as soil testing, weather forecasts, and online market prices, to make informed decisions.

In summary, by following these tips, the farm can grow Wheat on 3 acres of land with an expected yield of 20.46 tons per hectare (ha), fertilizer need of Rs. 60,000/ha, pest and weed control costs of Rs. 2,500/ha, planting of early-maturing varieties, rainwater harvesting system and sustainable practices to reduce soil erosion and water usage.
