I don't have access to specific data or information about your farming scenario. However, based on general guidelines for successful wheat farming, here's what you could do:

1. Choose the right variety of wheat for your climate and soil conditions. Look for varieties that yield well in your area and have good resistance to pests and diseases.

2. Plant your wheat crop at an appropriate time based on the forecasted temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Planting too early or too late can result in uneven growth and lower yields. It's recommended to plant during the first 3-4 weeks of spring.

3. Choose the right fertilizer mix for your soil type and pH level. Use organic fertilizers like compost or manure, as they provide nutrients without harming beneficial insects in the soil. If you need to use synthetic fertilizers, ensure that they are appropriate for your wheat variety and don't exceed the recommended rate per acre.

4. Water your wheat crop correctly. Watering too much or not enough can lead to moisture stress, which affects plant growth and can cause disease outbreaks. Water slowly and aim for an average of 1-2 inches per week throughout the growing season.

5. Monitor pest and disease problems as they emerge. Use pesticides or insecticides when necessary but avoid using chemicals that are toxic to beneficial insects in your area. Monitor soil samples regularly for signs of pests and diseases.

6. Manage weeds proactively. Weed out unwanted plants or use herbicide sprays if necessary, but avoid using strong herbicides that can harm beneficial insects.

7. Harvest your wheat crop according to the local harvesting schedule, usually around 6-10 days after planting.

8. Maintain healthy soil and plants by applying organic fertilizers and compost regularly.

9. Regularly inspect your farm for pests, diseases, or other issues that need attention. Address any problems promptly to avoid further damage to the crop or any negative impact on the surrounding ecosystem.

by following these guidelines, you can help ensure a successful harvest of wheat crops and achieve your financial goal while maintaining the quality and quantity of your produce.
