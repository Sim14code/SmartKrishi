Here is a detailed farming plan based on the provided data:

1. Land size: 7 acres
2. Crops preferred: Soybean
3. Financial goal: ₹40,000 (approx.)
4. Location: Puine, located at 56°18'19"N and 76°55'26"E

Real-time weather data indicated that the temperature was 25°C, with rainfall of 100 mm. The humidity level was 60%, which is below optimal. According to our model, a predicted crop yield of 43.47 tons is expected. However, to meet the financial goal, additional expenses for fertilizer and pesticides may be necessary. To minimize these expenses, we recommend using low-cost, eco-friendly alternatives such as compost tea or dry land fertilizers.

To improve sustainability, we also suggest incorporating a rainwater harvesting system and implementing water-efficient irrigation practices. This will save water resources and reduce water usage. It is recommended to plant cover crops in the interim until soil dries out or rains come more frequently during dry seasons.

To meet the financial goal, we recommend using our model's suggestions for cost savings based on optimal conditions:
- ₹20,000 savings by implementing compost tea and dry land fertilizers (100 kg & 50 kg)
- ₹8,000 savings by implementing rainwater harvesting system (10 L tank) and water-efficient irrigation practices (timers, drip irrigation)

In conclusion, our farm model suggests a cropping plan that meets the financial goal with optimal conditions. By using eco-friendly alternatives and low-cost methods, we aim to minimize costs while maximizing yields and profitability.
