1. Determine the crop's expected yield based on data: The farmer has estimated that they will receive â‚¹90,000 per acre of land for Wheat, which is based on average yields of 45-50 tons per acre in their area.
2. Calculate the fertilizer and pest control needs: According to the data, the farmer will need approximately 376.4 kg of fertilizer for each acre of land. In addition, they should also apply pesticides or herbicides based on the crop's susceptibility to pests.
3. Determine the required amount of water: The farmer will have 10-15 hours of sunlight per day during the growing season. Therefore, they need to use enough water for irrigation purposes, which should be calculated based on the number of acres and estimated daily rainfall during that time of year.
4. Calculate the required amount of manure: The farmer will need a minimum of 320 kg of compost per acre of land to provide adequate nutrients for the Wheat crop.
5. Determine the number of plants per acre: In general, Wheat needs approximately 40-60 plants to cover the soil surface and establish a strong root system. Based on the average yield per acre, it is recommended that the farmer plant at least 40-60 wheat plants per acre for optimal yield and crop health.
6. Determine irrigation requirements: The required amount of water will depend on the soil type, soil moisture content, and climate conditions. To determine irrigation requirements, it is recommended that the farmer should use a rainwater harvesting system to collect rainfall in their region. This ensures that they are not deprived of water during periods of drought.
7. Calculate the amount of labor required: The farm may require additional labor for planting, irrigation, and harvesting the Wheat crop. Additionally, the farmer should plan on hiring a contractor or a professional to help with tasks such as soil preparation, weeding, and harvesting.
8. Set up a system for pest control: The farmer should set up systems for pest control, including pesticide application if needed, to ensure the crop's health and quality. This may include using organic options or following best practices from local extension services.
9. Plan for harvesting: The harvesting process is usually based on the expected yield per acre, which can vary depending on weather conditions and pest control methods used. It is essential to plan for harvested crops to be processed properly, with minimum spoilage or waste.
10. Implement an agricultural calendar: The farmer should plan their crop production schedule based on the optimal time of year when wheat can be grown and harvested successfully. This will help them achieve their financial goal by targeting ideal planting and harvesting dates, while ensuring timely crop delivery to customers.
