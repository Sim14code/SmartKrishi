Translated to Hindi: To provide a detailed farming plan, based on the above data and weather insights, here are some key recommendations:

1. Riceland Preferences: The farmer's crop preferences have been recorded, so we can suggest alternative crops with similar yields that may be suitable for this location. Some examples could include:
- Oatmeal Rice: Another option is to grow oatmeal rice, which is more nutritious and has a higher yield than rice. It's also known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions.

2. Financial Goal: The farmer has set a financial goal of â‚¹90000. To achieve this, some key recommendations could be:
- Adjusting water and labor inputs accordingly: Farmers can reduce their irrigation and labor costs by adopting alternative crops or crop management practices like pest control or soil conservation.
- Implementing crop diversification: Diversifying the crops grown with different root systems helps increase yield potential, while reducing the risk of crop failure.

3. Location: Consider the location's specific weather and climate conditions. For instance, if it's a hot, dry region, it may require more watering to keep the soil moist and prevent the crops from wilting or dying. On the other hand, if it's a rainy season, it may need less irrigation, which can help reduce costs.

4. Weather Forecast: Monitoring weather forecasts, such as precipitation and temperature trends, can provide insights into how much rain and heat are expected during the growing season. This data can help adjust planting schedules or adjust crop management practices.

5. Crops & Yields: Based on previous experience, selecting the appropriate crops that grow well in this area and yielding similar to previous seasons could be beneficial for achieving financial goals. The farmer may also consider optimizing soil nutrients, irrigation schedules, or crop rotation to increase yields.

By following these recommendations, the farmer can develop a detailed farming plan with the aim of maximizing profits while minimizing costs.
